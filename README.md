I created this simple app for learning purposes.

With this app, the user can calculate their BMR/BMI level and, based on the edamam.com API, the user has access to thousands of recipes that can be searched by category or directly searched by name. Each recipe also has a page that displays detailed information such as ingredients and nutritional values.
